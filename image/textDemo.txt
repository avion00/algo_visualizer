what is algorithm visualizer?
Algorithm visualizer is a tool that helps you understand how algorithms work by visualizing the steps involved in
the algorithm. It is a graphical representation of the algorithm's execution, making it easier to comprehend
and debug the code.

how can i use visualizer algorithm
You can use an algorithm visualizer in several ways:

1.  **Step-by-Step Execution**: The visualizer allows you to execute the algorithm step
by step, making it easier to understand the flow of the algorithm.
2.  **Pause and Resume**: You can pause the execution of the algorithm at any point and
resume it when you are ready.
3.  **Step Back**: You can step back to a previous step and see how the algorithm
changed.
4.  **Visualize Data**: The visualizer can display the data being processed by the algorithm
5.  **Compare Algorithms**: You can compare the execution of different algorithms on the same
data.
6.  **Debugging**: The visualizer can help you debug your code by allowing you to
see the execution of the algorithm and identify any errors.
7.  **Learning**: The visualizer can be a great tool for learning algorithms, as it
makes it easier to understand how they work.
